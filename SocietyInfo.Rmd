## Society Aims

Traditional cognitive science has largely ignored cultural influences on cognition and has also predominantly concentrated on a group of people who are not particularly representative of the world's population as a whole. Yet, today, we have an increasing amount of empirical and theoretical work that emphasizes cultural and social influences on mind and brain, including through bodily modulations. An increasing number of researchers believe that cognitive science cannot ignore culture as a crucial factor impacting mental processes and brain functioning. A focus on individuals and their experiences in cultural environments has become more and more important. This approach has emerged in all fields that have been associated with cognitive science, from neuroscience to philosophy of mind.

We believe it is indispensable to look at different cultures and diverse participant populations so that we can understand what kind of findings from the mostly Western research body generalize (or not) to diverse populations and across cultures. We want to explore, for example, how cultural inventions like written words, numbers, music, and belief systems shape the mind and brain from the beginning of our lives and through exposure to cultural objects across the lifecycle. We welcome contributions from all these fields of research.This society aims to encourage discussion of the latest developments in the cognitive science of culture, to provide a platform for exchanging ideas, and a network to foster collaborations among interested researchers. We particularly encourage research involving non-WEIRD participant populations. We want to understand the human mind (and not just the minds of Western undergraduates) and how cultural objects (e.g., literacy; religion), including those within culture at macro-level, can shape the human brain and mind. We especially encourage participation by researchers from all parts of the world. Another important aim of the society is public outreach, for instance, to promote the application of research findings for the greater good of humanity.
